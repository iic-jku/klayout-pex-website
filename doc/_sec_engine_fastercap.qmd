## `FasterCap` Engine

`FasterCap` is a 3D and 2D parallel capacitance field solver, inspired by `FastCap2`.
<https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/fastercap.htm>

Starting from an input layout (e.g. GDS file) and a process stack-up (part of the @sec-tech-def), `KPEX` creates input geometries for `FasterCap`.

After running `FasterCap`, the Maxwell capacitance matrix is parsed and interpreted to obtain the parasitic capacitances.

### 3D Input Geometries

`FasterCap` supports 2D and 3D input geometries. 

![`FasterCap` 3D Input: File System Overview](figures/fastercap-input-geometry-3D-part1.svg)

`KPEX` generates 3D input geometries:
- `*.lst` file: Main input file
  - defines dielectric instances
  - defines conductor instances
  - each instance refers to a `*.geo` file
- `*.geo` files: Defines single geometry
  - defines shapes (e.g. triangles)
  - Each shape has a reference point to define inside/outsides

### Output Maxwell Capacitance Matrix

- `FasterCap` log output prints the Maxwell Capacitance Matrix (one for each iteration/refinement)
- Matrix Properties:
  - Scaling: units have to be divided by $10^{-6}$
  - rows and columns are the same (list of net names)
  - Row Cells:
    - off diagonals cells contains the coupling between row/col nets (times $-1$)
    - diagonal cells contains the sum of the absolute values of all other cells in the row
  - Matrix Symmetry:
    - in theory (ideal world), the matrix would be symmetric
    - in practice it's not  
    - therefore `FastCap2` did average the off-diagonals
