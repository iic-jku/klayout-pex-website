# `KPEX/FasterCap` Engine  {#sec-kpex-fastercap}

`FasterCap` is a 3D and 2D parallel capacitance field solver, inspired by `FastCap2`.
<https://www.fastfieldsolvers.com/fastercap.htm>

Starting from an input layout (e.g. GDS file) and a process stack-up (part of the @sec-tech-def), `KPEX` creates input geometries for `FasterCap`. After running `FasterCap`, the Maxwell capacitance matrix is parsed and interpreted to obtain the parasitic capacitances.

See @sec-first-steps-run-fastercap-engine to get started with a first extraction example.

## 3D Input Geometries

![`FasterCap` 3D Input: File System Overview](figures/fastercap-input-geometry-3D-part1.svg)

The `FasterCap` input files and their format is documented in [@fastfieldsolvers-fastercap-manual-chm], a PDF version of the Windows-specific `*.chm` file is available at <https://github.com/martinjankoehler/FasterCap/tree/master/doc/pdf>.

`KPEX` generates 3D input geometries:

- `*.lst` file: Main input file
  - defines dielectric instances
  - defines conductor instances
  - each instance refers to a `*.geo` file
- `*.geo` files: Defines single geometry
  - defines shapes (e.g. triangles)
  - Each shape has a reference point to define inside/outsides

MOM Capacitor
:::

@fig-fastercap-mom-example depicts the MOM capacitor example of a from @sec-first-steps-run-fastercap-engine).

The corresponding schematic representation of @fig-fastercap-maxwell-capacitance-matrix-schematic contains 3 conductors ($N_1$, $N_2$ and $N_3$), and coupling capacitances:

- Capacitances between conductors: $C_{ij} \text{ where } i \ne j$
  - $C_{23}$ is the capacitance "intended" by the MOM designer
- Capacitances between conductors and ground: $C_{ii}$

## Output Maxwell Capacitance Matrix

A Maxwell capacitance matrix [@Maxwell_1873] provides the relation between voltages on a set of conductors and the charges on these conductors, as described by the `FasterCap` author in the white paper [@fastfieldsolvers-maxwell-capacitance-matrix].

`FasterCap` log output prints the Maxwell capacitance matrix (one for each iteration/refinement).

- Matrix Properties:
  - Scaling: units have to be divided by $10^{-6}$
  - rows and columns are the same (list of net names)
  - Row Cells:
    - off diagonals cells contains the coupling between row/col nets (times $-1$)
    - diagonal cells contains the sum of the absolute values of all other cells in the row
  - Matrix Symmetry:
    - in theory (ideal world), the matrix would be symmetric
    - in practice it's not  
    - therefore `FastCap2` did average the off-diagonals
    - `FasterCap` does not average, so it's done as part of `KPEX`
