## 2.5D Engine

Field solvers are precise, yet slow, they are useful to obtain a golden reference.
For most use cases, a faster engine is desirable.
The `KPEX` 2.5D Engine intends to implement the concepts and formulas of `MAGIC` (see @sec-magic-cap-types) in a way that is best suited to the `KLayout` API.
