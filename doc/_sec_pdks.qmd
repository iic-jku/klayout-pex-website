# Supporting new PDKs

For every supported PDK[^abbrev-pdk], a `KPEX` technology definition is required, as well as customized PEX-"LVS" scripts.

## Customized PEX-"LVS" scripts

`KLayout` has built-in support for Layout-Versus-Schematic (LVS) scripts, based on its Ruby API.
Customized "LVS" scripts are ("ab")used in `KPEX`, not with the intent of comparing Layout-Versus-Schematic, but rather to extract the connectivity/net information for all polygons across multiple layers.
The resulting net information is stored in a `KLayout LVS Database` ("LVSDB") within the run directory.

![`KPEX` Net Formation](figures/kpex-net-formation.svg)

These customized "LVS" scripts are stored in:

- Skywater sky130A: [`pdk/sky130A/libs.tech/kpex/sky130.lvs`]({{< var urls.repo.kpex >}}/blob/main/pdk/sky130A/libs.tech/kpex/sky130.lvs)
- IHP SG13G2: [`pdk/ihp_sg13gs/libs.tech/kpex/sg13g2.lvs`]({{< var urls.repo.kpex >}}/blob/main/pdk/ihp_sg13g2/libs.tech/kpex/sg13g2.lvs)

What's specific about this customization:

- Layers names must be assigned, using [KLayout's `(name(layer, name))` function](https://www.klayout.de/doc-qt5/about/drc_ref_netter.html#name)
- MOM[^abbrev-mom] capacitors, MIM[^abbrev-mim] capacitors and resistors should be extracted to separate layers, to enable blackboxing / whiteboxing.

The layer names in the script must correspond with the names configured in the tech JSON file.

## Technology Definition Files {#sec-tech-def}

The `KPEX` technology definition format uses [Google Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.net), so there is:

- formal schema files, defining the structure and data types involved
   - [`protos/tech.proto`]({{< var urls.repo.kpex >}}/blob/main/protos/tech.proto): main schema / entry point, includes the others
   - [`protos/process_stack.proto`]({{< var urls.repo.kpex >}}/blob/main/protos/process_stack.proto): describes details of the process stack, such as dielectrics and heights of layers
   - [`protos/process_parasitics.proto`]({{< var urls.repo.kpex >}}/blob/main/protos/process_parasitics.proto): parasitic tables, used to parametrize the 2.5D engine
- multiple concrete instantiations, that adhere to this schema (called *messages* in the `protobuf` lingo)
   - in the form of JSON files
   - Skywater 130A: `klayout_pex_protobuf/sky130A_tech.pb.json`
   - IHP SG13G2: `klayout_pex_protobuf/ihp_sg13g2_tech.pb.json`

::: {.callout-note}
The built-in JSON tech files are programmatically generated during the build process[^tech-gen-script].
Therefore they not part of the repository source code, but of course part of the deployed Python wheels.
To review those, look into your Python `site-packages`[^kpex-site-packages]/`klayout_pex_protobuf`.

### Process Stackup Definition

For 3D solvers, like the `KPEX/FasterCap` engine, 3D information about the dimensions (e.g. z-offset and thickness) of metal layers is required, as well as the dielectrics in-between.

The Skywater `sky130A` process includes more intricate types of dielectrics (e.g., compared to IHP `sg13g2`), therefore I'll use this PDK as an example here.


![Skywater `sky130A` Process Stackup (Source: [@skywater-sky130-pdk])](figures/skywater-sky130-metal_stack.svg){#fig-skywater-sky130-metal-stack}

@fig-skywater-sky130-metal-stack contains the following data:

- Metal layers $= \{\text{poly}, \text{li}, \text{metal1}, \text{metal2}, \text{metal3}, \text{metal4}, \text{metal5}, \text{capm}, \text{cap2m} \}$
   - thickness
   - z-offset (relative to substrate)
- Contact layers $= \{\text{licon}\}$
- Via layers $= \{\text{mcon}, \text{via1}, \text{via2}, \text{via3}, \text{via4}\}$
- Dielectrics
   - dielectric constant $k$, the relative permittivity of the dielectric material
   - Different types:
      - Sidewall dielectrics $= \{\text{IOX}, \text{SPNIT}, \text{NILD3\_C}, \text{NILD4\_C}\}$
         - width of the sidewall around metals
         - height above metal
      - Conformal dielectrics $= \{\text{LINT}, \text{TOPNIT}, \text{capild}\}$
         - thickness above metal
         - thickness where no metal
         - thickness of the sidewall
      - Simple dielectrics $= \{\text{PSG}, \text{NILD2}, \text{NILD3}, \text{NILD4}, \text{NILD5}, \text{NILD6}\}$
         - embracing everything between 2 layers, including the sidewall and conformal dielectrics
