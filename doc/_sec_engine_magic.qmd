# `KPEX/MAGIC` Engine  {#sec-kpex-magic}

This engine is merely just a wrapper around `magic`, which prepares a TCL script that opens the layout file and starts MAGIC's PEX flow.
See @sec-first-steps-run-magic-engine to get started with a first extraction example.

The following chapter will illustrate concepts of the parasitic extraction done in `MAGIC`, also motivated by the fact that the engine in @sec-engine-kpex-2_5D will be based on those.
Major parts of this illustration, the figures and concepts are based on work done by `MAGIC` maintainer Tim Edwards, especially his talk from FSiC conference 2022 [@edwards-2022-fsic-talk] and a (conceptual follow-up) ChipsAlliance meeting on April 4, 2023, see  [@edwards-2023-chipsalliance-talk-video] and [@edwards-2023-chipsalliance-talk-slides].
In addition, code review and debugging of the MAGIC codebase was performed.

## MAGIC database units

- To convert between MAGIC database units and $\mu m$, a scaling factor $\alpha$ is used, so that $L_{\mu m} = \frac{L_{dbu}}{\alpha}$
- E.g. for `sky130A`, $\alpha = 200.0$

## Types of Parasitic Capacitances {#sec-magic-cap-types}

MAGIC models multiple types of capacitances:

- *Substrate Overlap:* Overlap area of a metal with the substrate
- *Substrate Fringing:* Sidewall of a metal fringes out to substrate
- *Sidewall Capacitance:* Coupling between adjacent sidewalls on the same layer
- *Overlap Capacitance:* Overlap on different metal layers
- *Fringe Capacitance ("Side Overlap"):* Sidewall of a metal fringes out other metal layers

## Substrate Capacitance

![](figures/magic_cap_type_-_substrate.svg){width=50%}

- Overlapping area:
$$
C_{area} = \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{d} * \text{area} \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{F}{\mu m^2} * \mu m^2\right]
$$
- Fringe ("Perimeter"):
$$
C_{fringe\,to\,substrate} = \text{perimeter} * C_{perim} = (2l + 2w)*C_{perim}
$$

- Coefficients like $C_{perim}$ are part of the tech files (Parasitic Tables)

## Sidewall Capacitance   {#sec-magic-cap-types-sidewall-capacitance}

![](figures/magic_cap_type_-_sidewall.svg){width=65%}

$$
C_{sidewall} = \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{s} * \text{sidewall area}  \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{F}{\mu m^2} * \mu m^2\right]
$$
$$
\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,= \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{s} * t * l  \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{F}{\mu m^2} * \mu m * \mu m\right]
$$
$$
C_{sidewall} = \frac{C_{sidewall\,coeff}}{s} * l \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{F}{\mu m} * \mu m\right]
$$

::: {{.callout-note}}
- Coefficients are part of the tech files (Parasitic Tables)
- Layer thickness $t$ is normally multiplied into the coefficient
- Foundry tables give constant coefficient referenced to $s = 1$

## Overlap Capacitance   {#sec-magic-cap-types-overlap-capacitance}

- Overlapping area:
$$
C_{area} = \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{d} * \text{area} \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{F}{\mu m^2} * \mu m^2\right]
$$

## Fringe Capacitance   {#sec-magic-cap-types-fringe-capacitance}

![Fringe Capacitance: Overlapping (1)](figures/magic_cap_type_-_fringe_3D.svg){width=50%}

- Causing sidewall (its bottom edge depicted red)
- Assume: Field is bounded by fringe halo (e.g. $8\, \mu m$ away from edge)
- Fractions of fringe goes to metal1 or substrate

![Fringe Capacitance: Overlapping (2)](figures/magic_cap_type_-_fringe_mom.svg){width=70%}

- Multiplier $\alpha$ (comes from tech files: overlap table)
  - determines how quickly fringe capacitance drops with increasing distance
  - $\alpha$ is related to distance $d$￼ between layers
  - $\alpha$ is proportional to $C_{overlap_{metal1 \leftrightarrow metal2}}= \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{d} * \text{area}$  
    (for fixed value of area $1\, \mu m^2$)
<!-- Markdown NOTE: to force the last list item two separate lines, I've added 2 blanks at the end of the first line  -->

- Fringe Fractions:
  - $\text{frac}_{metal1} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha_{metal2 \rightarrow metal1}*x)$
  - $\text{frac}_{sub} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha_{metal2 \rightarrow sub}*(\text{halo}-x))$
  - $\tfrac{2}{\pi}$ is multiplied because of scaling to interval $[0.0,\,1.0]$, as￼$\text{atan}(\infty)=\tfrac{\pi}{2}$

- Overlap capacitance:
  - $C_{overlap} = \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{d} * \text{area} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(\text{with area}=1 \mu m^2)$
- Coupling capacitance $metal1 \leftrightarrow metal2$:
  - $\alpha_{metal1 \leftrightarrow metal2} = \alpha_{scalefac} * C_{overlap_{metal1 \leftrightarrow metal2}}$
  - $\text{frac}_{metal1} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha_{metal1 \leftrightarrow metal2}*x)$
  - $\text{effective length} = \text{edge length} * \text{frac}_{metal1}$
  - $C_{fringe_{metal2 \rightarrow metal1}} = \text{effective length} * C_{sideoverlap_{metal2 \rightarrow metal1}}$
- Coupling capacitance $metal1 \leftrightarrow sub$:
  - $\alpha_{metal1 \leftrightarrow sub} = \alpha_{scalefac} * C_{overlap_{metal1 \leftrightarrow sub}}$
  - $\text{frac}_{sub} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha_{metal1 \leftrightarrow sub}*(\text{halo}-x))$
  - $\text{effective length} = \text{edge length} * \text{frac}_{sub}$
  - $C_{fringe_{metal2 \rightarrow sub}} = \text{effective length} * C_{sideoverlap_{metal2 \rightarrow sub}}$

![Fringe Capacitance: Non Overlapping (1)](figures/magic_cap_type_-_fringe_3D_-_non_overlapping.svg){width=50%}

- Partial side overlap
  - In case there is only a partial side overlap, the non-existing near fraction is subtracted from the far fraction
  - $metal1$ wire is offset, starts at $x_{near}$
  - $metal1$ ends at $x_{far}$

![Fringe Capacitance: Non Overlapping (2)](figures/magic_cap_type_-_fringe_mom_-_non_overlapping.svg){width=70%}

- $\text{frac}_{near} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha*x_{near})$
- $\text{frac}_{far} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha*x_{far})$
- $\text{frac} = \text{frac}_{far}-\text{frac}_{near}$

Shielding Effects
:::

Note, given an analyzed sidewall (edge in 2D), lateral fringe shielding 

- is caused by opposing shapes on the same layer
   - even by the same polygon
   - by other polygons (same net)
   - by other polygons (different net) --- this is what we also look at when analyzing sidewall coupling
- will shield the fringing to the lower layers, i.e. in @fig-lateral-fringe-shielding-2 the coupling between the two shapes is the same in the above and below cases

## Parasitic Resistance

Magic constructs a graph of resistors between nodes

- device terminals
- pins
- junctions (vias or branching on the same metal layer)

![](figures/resistance_extraction_example1.svg)

![](figures/resistance_extraction_example2.svg)


### Wire resistance {#sec-magic-resistance-wire}

- Given a wire with length $l$ and height $h$, the basic formula is 
$$
R_{wire} = \frac{l}{h} * R_{coeff}  \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{\mu m}{\mu m} * mΩ\right]
$$

- Coefficient $R_{coeff}$ is part of the tech files (Parasitic Tables)
   - defined for every metal layer
   - in $mΩ$ for $1\,{\mu m}^2$
   - Coefficient already includes the thickness aspect of the layer, so the formula works in 2D

### Via resistance {#sec-magic-resistance-via}

![Via dimensions)](figures/magic_via_-_dimensions.svg){#fig-magic-via-dimensions width=40%}

- Given 
   - drawn via in the layout, with width $w$ and height $h$
   - design rules defined for each via layer:
     - via width $viawidth$
     - $spacing$ between vias (in case of a via array)
     - $border$ on each side of the via
- `MAGIC` interpretation of the via drawing
   - determine number of vias in $x$ and $y$ direction, i.e. $n_x$ and $n_y$
   - if $x$ and $y$ dimensions are below the minimum size, `MAGIC` counts 1 via in each direction
   - if the dimensions are larger, we calculate how much vias fit

$$
R_{via} = \frac{R_{coeff}}{n_x * n_y}   \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[\frac{mΩ}{\text{via count}}\right]
$$

$$
n_x = 1 + \left\lfloor\frac{w - (viawidth + 2 * border)}{viawidth + spacing}\right\rfloor
$$

$$
n_y = 1 + \left\lfloor\frac{h - (viawidth + 2 * border)}{viawidth + spacing}\right\rfloor
$$


- Coefficient $R_{coeff}$ is part of the tech files (Parasitic Tables)
   - defined for every via layer
   - in $mΩ$ per via
   - Coefficient already includes the thickness aspect of the layer, so the formula works in 2D
