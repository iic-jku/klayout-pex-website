# `KPEX/MAGIC` Engine

This engine is merely just a wrapper around `magic`, which prepares a TCL script that opens the layout file and starts MAGIC's PEX flow.
See @sec-first-steps-run-magic-engine to get started with a first extraction example.

The following chapter will illustrate concepts of the parasitic extraction done in `MAGIC`, also motivated by the fact that the engine in @sec-engine-kpex-2_5D will be based on those.
Major parts of this illustration, the figures and concepts are based on work done by `MAGIC` maintainer Tim Edwards, especially his talk from FSiC conference 2022 [@edwards-2022-fsic-talk] and a (conceptual follow-up) ChipsAlliance meeting on April 4, 2023, see  [@edwards-2023-chipsalliance-talk-video] and [@edwards-2023-chipsalliance-talk-slides].
In addition, code review and debugging of the MAGIC codebase was performed.

## Types of Parasitic Capacitances {#sec-magic-cap-types}

MAGIC models multiple types of capacitances:

- *Substrate Overlap*: Overlap area of a metal with the substrate
- *Substrate Fringing*: Sidewall of a metal fringes out to substrate
- *Sidewall Capacitance*: Coupling between adjacent sidewalls on the same layer
- *Overlap Capacitance*: Overlap on different metal layers
- *Fringe Capacitance* ("Side Overlap"): Sidewall of a metal fringes out other metal layers

## Substrate Capacitance

![](figures/magic_cap_type_-_substrate.svg){width=50%}

- Overlapping area:
$$
C_{area} = \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{d} * \text{area} \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{F}{\mu m^2} * \mu m^2\right]
$$
- Fringe ("Perimeter"):
$$
C_{fringe\,to\,substrate} = \text{perimeter} * C_{perim} = (2l + 2w)*C_{perim}
$$

- Coefficients like $C_{perim}$ are part of the tech files (Parasitic Tables)

## Sidewall Capacitance

![](figures/magic_cap_type_-_sidewall.svg){width=65%}

$$
C_{sidewall} = \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{s} * \text{sidewall area}  \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{F}{\mu m^2} * \mu m^2\right]
$$
$$
\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,= \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{s} * t * l  \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{F}{\mu m^2} * \mu m * \mu m\right]
$$
$$
C_{sidewall} = \frac{C_{sidewall\,coeff}}{s} * l \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{F}{\mu m} * \mu m\right]
$$

::: {{.callout-note}}
- Coefficients are part of the tech files (Parasitic Tables)
- Layer thickness $t$ is normally multiplied into the coefficient
- Foundry tables give constant coefficient referenced to $s = 1$

## Overlap Capacitance

- Overlapping area:
$$
C_{area} = \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{d} * \text{area} \,\,\,\,\,\,\, \left[ \frac{F}{\mu m^2} * \mu m^2\right]
$$

## Fringe Capacitance

![Fringe Capacitance: Overlapping (1)](figures/magic_cap_type_-_fringe_3D.svg){width=50%}

- Causing sidewall (its bottom edge depicted red)
- Assume: Field is bounded by fringe halo (e.g. $8\, \mu m$ away from edge)
- Fractions of fringe goes to metal1 or substrate

![Fringe Capacitance: Overlapping (2)](figures/magic_cap_type_-_fringe_mom.svg){width=70%}

- Multiplier $\alpha$ (comes from tech files: overlap table)
  - determines how quickly fringe capacitance drops with increasing distance
  - $\alpha$ is related to distance $d$￼ between layers
  - $\alpha$ is proportional to $C_{overlap_{metal1 \leftrightarrow metal2}}= \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{d} * \text{area}$  
    (for fixed value of area $1\, \mu m^2$)
<!-- Markdown NOTE: to force the last list item two separate lines, I've added 2 blanks at the end of the first line  -->

- Fringe Fractions:
  - $\text{frac}_{metal1} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha_{metal2 \rightarrow metal1}*x)$
  - $\text{frac}_{sub} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha_{metal2 \rightarrow sub}*(\text{halo}-x))$
  - $\tfrac{2}{\pi}$ is multiplied because of scaling to interval $[0.0,\,1.0]$, as￼$\text{atan}(\infty)=\tfrac{\pi}{2}$

- Overlap capacitance:
  - $C_{overlap} = \frac{\epsilon_{si} * K}{d} * \text{area} \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,(\text{with area}=1 \mu m^2)$
- Coupling capacitance $metal1 \leftrightarrow metal2$:
  - $\alpha_{metal1 \leftrightarrow metal2} = \alpha_{scalefac} * C_{overlap_{metal1 \leftrightarrow metal2}}$
  - $\text{frac}_{metal1} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha_{metal1 \leftrightarrow metal2}*x)$
  - $\text{effective length} = \text{edge length} * \text{frac}_{metal1}$
  - $C_{fringe_{metal2 \rightarrow metal1}} = \text{effective length} * C_{sideoverlap_{metal2 \rightarrow metal1}}$
- Coupling capacitance $metal1 \leftrightarrow sub$:
  - $\alpha_{metal1 \leftrightarrow sub} = \alpha_{scalefac} * C_{overlap_{metal1 \leftrightarrow sub}}$
  - $\text{frac}_{sub} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha_{metal1 \leftrightarrow sub}*(\text{halo}-x))$
  - $\text{effective length} = \text{edge length} * \text{frac}_{sub}$
  - $C_{fringe_{metal2 \rightarrow sub}} = \text{effective length} * C_{sideoverlap_{metal2 \rightarrow sub}}$

![Fringe Capacitance: Non Overlapping (1)](figures/magic_cap_type_-_fringe_3D_-_non_overlapping.svg){width=50%}

- Partial side overlap
  - In case there is only a partial side overlap, the non-existing near fraction is subtracted from the far fraction
  - $metal1$ wire is offset, starts at $x_{near}$
  - $metal1$ ends at $x_{far}$

![Fringe Capacitance: Non Overlapping (2)](figures/magic_cap_type_-_fringe_mom_-_non_overlapping.svg){width=70%}

- $\text{frac}_{near} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha*x_{near})$
- $\text{frac}_{far} = \tfrac{2}{\pi} * \text{atan}(\alpha*x_{far})$
- $\text{frac} = \text{frac}_{far}-\text{frac}_{near}$
